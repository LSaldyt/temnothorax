# Temnothorax Decision Models
Overview of several python models of ant decision making

This repository contains (at time of writing) 5 models:
 - Granivoskiy 2012, agent based
 - Pratt 2002, ordinary differential equations
 - Pratt 2005, agent based
 - Saldyt 2018, ordinary differential equations
 - Saldyt 2018, agent-based

The Pratt 2005 model is largely superseded by the Granivoskiy 2012 model.

The following plot shows convergence times based on nest distance:
